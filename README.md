# Design and Development of an Isolated Gate Driver Circuit

## Introduction

This project focuses on the design and development of two isolated gate driver circuits using:

- **HCPL-3120** – A high-speed optocoupler-based gate driver.  
- **UCC23513DWYR** – A high-performance isolated gate driver with reinforced insulation.  

The circuits are designed to efficiently drive power switches in high-frequency applications, ensuring **reliable isolation, fast switching, and enhanced noise immunity**. These gate drivers play a crucial role in power electronics applications such as **DC-DC converters, inverters, and motor drives**.
