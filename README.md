# 2.5 Amp Output Current IGBT Gate Drive **HCPL-3120** Optocoupler

## Introduction
The HCPL-3120 contains a Gallium Arsenic Phosphide (GaAsP) LED, while the HCPL-J312 and the HCNW3120 contain an AlGaAs LED. The LED is optically coupled to an integrated circuit with a power output stage. These optocouplers are ideally suited for driving power IGBTs and MOSFETs used in motor control inverter applications. The high operating voltage range of the output stage provides the drive voltages required by gate-controlled devices. The voltage and current supplied by these optocouplers make them ideally suited for directly driving IGBTs with ratings up to 1200 V/100 A. For IGBTs with higher ratings, the HCPL-3120 series can be used to drive a discrete power stage which drives the IGBT gate. The HCNW3120 has the highest insulation voltage of $V_{IORM}$ = 1230 $V_{peak}$  and the  $V_{IORM}$ = 630 $V_{peak}$ ia also avialable with the HCPL-J312.

## Key Features of the HCPL-3120 Gate Driver
### High-Speed Operation
The HCPL-3120 is designed for high-speed switching applications, making it suitable for use in power converters, motor drives, and other applications where fast switching speeds are required.

### Isolation
The HCPL-3120 provides electrical isolation between the input and output sides of the device. This isolation helps protect sensitive control circuitry from high-voltage transients and provides safety isolation in high-voltage applications.

### High Output Current
The HCPL-3120 is capable of driving high capacitive loads with its high output current capability, ensuring fast and efficient switching of power devices.

The HCPL-3120 includes UVLO protection, which ensures that the device operates correctly only when the supply voltage is within a specified range, helping to prevent damage to the device and ensuring reliable operation.

## Applications Information
A three-phase inverter requires six isolated gate drivers for IGBT switch control. The isolated gate driver used in this design is the HCPL-3120. This driver has an opto-LED input stage and is current-controlled. The gate driver is designed to be pin-to-pin compatible with existing opto-isolated gate drivers and is available in a wide-body stretched SO6 package.

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> HCPL-3120 Typical Application Circuit with Negative IGBT Gate Drive</p>  

To eliminate negative IGBT gate drive, minimize Rg and lead inductance from HCPL-3120 to IGBT gate/emitter. Mount HCPL-3120 directly above the IGBT on a small PCB. Avoid routing IGBT collector/emitter traces close to the HCPL-3120 input to prevent signal coupling. If unavoidable, reverse-bias the LED in the off state to prevent unwanted HCPL-3120 activation from transient signals.

# Selecting the Gate Resistor ($R_g$) to Minimize IGBT Switching Losses

## Step 1: Calculate $R_g$ Minimum from the $I_{OL}$ Peak Specification  

The IGBT and $R_g$ in Figure 26 can be analyzed as a simple RC circuit with a voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120.  

```math
R_g \geq \frac{V_{CC} - V_{EE} - V_{OL}}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{2.5A}
```

```math
= 7.2 \Omega \quad @ \quad 8 \Omega
```

The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value at the peak current of 2.5A (see Figure 6 [DataSheet]). At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts. <font color="red">When negative gate drive is not used, \( V_{EE} \) in the previous equation is equal to zero volts.</font>  

## Step 2: Check the HCPL-3120 Power Dissipation and Increase $R_g$ If Necessary  

The HCPL-3120 total power dissipation $P_T$ is equal to the sum of the emitter power $P_E$ and the output power $P_O$:  

```math
P_T = P_E + P_O
```

```math
P_E = I_F \times V_F \times \text{Duty Cycle}
```

```math
P_O = (P_{O(BIAS)} + P_{O(SWITCHING)})
```

```math
= I_{CC} \times (V_{CC} - V_{EE}) + E_{SW}(R_g, Q_g) \times f
```

For the circuit in **Figure 26** [DataSheet], the worst case is:  
- $I_{CC}$ = 16 mA  
- $R_g = 8 \Omega$  
- Max Duty Cycle = 80%  
- $Q_g = 500$ nC  
- $f = 20$ kHz  
- $T_A = 85^\circ C$

```math
P_E = 16 \text{ mA} \times 1.8V \times 0.8
```

```math
= 23 \text{ mW}
```

```math
P_O = 4.25 \text{ mA} \times 20V + 5.2 \text{ µJ} \times 20 \text{ kHz}
```

```math
= 85 \text{ mW} + 104 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 189 \text{ mW} \approx 178 \text{ mW} (P_{O(MAX)}) \text{ at } 85^\circ C
```

```math
= 250 \text{ mW} \approx 15^\circ C + 4.8 \text{ mW}/^\circ C
```

The value of 4.25 mA for \( I_{CC} \) in the previous equation was obtained by derating the $I_{CC}$ max of 5 mA (which occurs at -40°C) to $I_{CC}$ max at 85°C (see **Figure 7** [DataSheet]).  

Since $P_O$ for this case is greater than $P_{O(MAX)}$, \( R_g \) must be increased to reduce the HCPL-3120 power dissipation.  

```math
P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)} = P_{O(MAX)} - P_{O(BIAS)}
```

```math
= 178 \text{ mW} - 85 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 93 \text{ mW}
```

```math
E_{SW(MAX)} = \frac{P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)}}{f}
```

```math
= \frac{93 \text{ mW}}{20 \text{ kHz}}
```

```math
= 4.65 \text{ µJ}
```

For \( Q_g = 500 \) nC, from **Figure 27**, a value of \( E_{SW} = 4.65 \) µJ gives an \( R_g = 10.3 \Omega \).


The $VOL$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value of $VOL$ at the peak current of 2.5A. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts.

IGBTs need to be driven with a higher gate voltage swing than Si MOSFETs (+20V to -2V / -5V). The negative gate voltage must not go below -5V. Negative driving voltage is not mandatory and is suggested only when drain current is high (>50A). The external gate resistance must be appropriately selected to minimize or eliminate ringing in the gate drive circuit. Parasitics must be minimized. Therefore, the gate driver must be located as close as possible to the gate. It is recommended to connect a 10kΩ resistor between the gate and source to prevent excessive floating of the gate during the propagation delay.
