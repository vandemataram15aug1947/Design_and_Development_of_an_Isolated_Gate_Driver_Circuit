</p>  

<p align="center"><b>Figure 2:</b> HCPL-3120 Typical Application Circuit with Negative IGBT Gate Drive</p>  

To eliminate negative IGBT gate drive, minimize Rg and lead inductance from HCPL-3120 to IGBT gate/emitter. Mount HCPL-3120 directly above the IGBT on a small PCB. Avoid routing IGBT collector/emitter traces close to the HCPL-3120 input to prevent signal coupling. If unavoidable, reverse-bias the LED in the off state to prevent unwanted HCPL-3120 activation from transient signals.

# Selecting the Gate Resistor ($R_g$)

## Calculate $R_g$ Minimum from the $I_{OL}$ Peak Specification  

The IGBT and $R_g$ in **Figure 26 [DataSheet, Page No. 23]** can be analyzed as a simple RC circuit with a voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120.  

```math
R_g \geq \frac{V_{CC} - V_{EE} - V_{OL}}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{2.5A}
```

```math
= 7.2 Ω \approx 8 Ω
```

The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value at the peak current of 2.5A **Figure 6 [DataSheet, Page No. 17]**. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. **When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts**.

## Check the HCPL-3120 Power Dissipation and Increase $R_g$

The HCPL-3120 total power dissipation $P_T$ is equal to the sum of the emitter power $P_E$ and the output power $P_O$:  

```math
P_T = P_E + P_O
```

```math
P_E = I_F \times V_F \times \text{Duty Cycle}
```

```math
P_O = (P_{O(BIAS)} + P_{O(SWITCHING)})
```

```math
= I_{CC} \times (V_{CC} - V_{EE}) + E_{SW}(R_g, Q_g) \times f
```

For the circuit in **Figure 26 [See DataSheet, Page No. 23]**, the worst case is:  
- $I_{F}$ = 16 mA  
- $R_g = 8 \Omega$  
- Max Duty Cycle = 80%  
- $Q_g = 500$ nC  
- $f = 20$ kHz  
- $T_A = 85^\circ C$

```math
P_E = 16 \text{ mA} \times 1.8V \times 0.8
```

```math
= 23 \text{ mW}
```

```math
P_O = 4.25 \text{ mA} \times 20V + 5.2 \text{ µJ} \times 20 \text{ kHz}
```

```math
= 85 \text{ mW} + 104 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 189 \text{ mW} \approx 178 \text{ mW} (P_{O(MAX)}) \text{ at } 85^\circ C
```

```math
= 250 \text{ mW} \approx 15^\circ C + 4.8 \text{ mW}/^\circ C
```

The value of 4.25 mA for $I_{CC}$ in the previous equation was obtained by derating the $I_{CC}$ max of 5 mA (which occurs at -40°C) to $I_{CC}$ max at 85°C **Figure 7 [See DataSheet, Page No. 17]**.  

Since $P_O$ for this case is greater than $P_{O(MAX)}$, $R_g$ must be increased to reduce the HCPL-3120 power dissipation.  

```math
P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)} = P_{O(MAX)} - P_{O(BIAS)}
```

```math
= 178 \text{ mW} - 85 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 93 \text{ mW}
```

```math
E_{SW(MAX)} = \frac{P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)}}{f}
```

```math
= \frac{93 \text{ mW}}{20 \text{ kHz}}
```

```math
= 4.65 \text{ µJ}
```

For $Q_g = 500$ nC, from **Figure 27 [See DataSheet, Page No. 24]**, a value of $E_{SW}$ = 4.65 µJ gives an $R_g$ = 10.3 \Omega.


The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value of $V_{OL}$ at the peak current of 2.5A. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts.

IGBTs need to be driven with a higher gate voltage swing than Si MOSFETs (+20V to -2V / -5V). The negative gate voltage must not go below -5V. Negative driving voltage is not mandatory and is suggested only when drain current is high (>50A). **The external gate resistance must be appropriately selected to minimize or eliminate ringing in the gate drive circuit. Parasitics must be minimized. Therefore, the gate driver must be located as close as possible to the gate. It is recommended to connect a 10kΩ resistor between the gate and source to prevent excessive floating of the gate during the propagation delay**.

# Feature Description

## Power Supply
Since the input stage is an emulated diode, no power supply is needed at the input. The output supply, $V_{CC}$, supports a voltage range from 14V to 33V.

For operation with bipolar supplies, the power device is turned off with a negative voltage on the gate with respect to the emitter or source. This configuration prevents the power device from unintentionally turning on due to the Miller effect. The typical values of the $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$ output supplies for bipolar operation are:
- **IGBTs:** 15V and -8V with respect to GND.
- **SiC MOSFETs:** 20V and -5V with respect to GND.

For operation with unipolar supply:
- **IGBTs:** $V_{CC}$ = 15V with respect to GND, $V_{EE}$ = 0V.
- **SiC MOSFETs:** $V_{CC}$ = 20V with respect to GND, $V_{EE}$ = 0V.

In this design, the secondary side is powered by a +15V and –8V rail referenced to the IGBT emitter. As shown in Figure 3.2:
- The 15V rail ($V_{CC}$) is connected to the $V_{CC}$ pin.
- The –8V rail ($V_{EE}$) is connected to the $V_{EE}$ pin of the gate driver.

The total secondary voltage is **23V**, which is used for biasing the gate driver internal circuit and to drive the IGBT gate.

## Input Power Stage
The input stage of **UCC23513DWYR** is simply the e-diode and therefore has an **Anode (Pin 1)** and a **Cathode (Pin 3)**. **Pin 2** has no internal connection and can be left open or connected to ground. The input stage does not have a power and ground pin.

When the e-diode is forward biased by applying a positive voltage to the Anode with respect to the Cathode, a forward current **($I_F$)** flows into the e-diode. The forward voltage drop across the e-diode is **2.1V (typical)**. An external resistor should be used to limit the forward current. The recommended range for the forward current is **7mA to 16mA**.

When **$I_F$** exceeds the threshold current **$I_{FLH}$** (2.8mA typical.), a high-frequency signal is transmitted across the isolation barrier through the high-voltage **SiO₂ capacitors**. The HF signal is detected by the receiver and **$V_{OUT}$** is driven high. The dynamic impedance of the e-diode is very small (**<1.0 Ω**) and the temperature coefficient of the e-diode forward voltage drop is **<1.35 mV/°C**. This leads to excellent stability of the forward current **$I_F$** across all operating conditions.

If the Anode voltage drops below **$V_{FHL}$** (0.9V), or is reverse biased, the gate driver output is driven low. The reverse breakdown voltage of the e-diode is **>15V**, allowing normal operation with a reverse bias of up to **13V**.

The **UCC23513DWYR** can be used in an **interlock architecture**, where **$V_{SUP}$** can be as high as **12V**. The system designer has the flexibility to choose a **3.3V, 5.0V, or up to 12V** PWM signal source to drive the input stage of UCC23513DWYR using an appropriate input resistor.

The interlock architecture ensures that if both PWM signals are erroneously stuck high (or low) simultaneously, both gate driver outputs will be driven low, preventing shoot-through in the IGBTs.

## Output Power Stage
The **UCC23513DWYR** has a single gate driver output for controlling the **IGBT switching time**. A **gate resistor R5** of **30Ω** is selected as recommended in the IGBT module datasheet. This results in maximum peak **source and sink currents of 0.766 A** at a **+15V, –8V rail**.

For independent control of the **IGBT switching ON and OFF**, **D1** can be mounted in parallel with **R5**. A **10kΩ resistor (R6)** is connected between the **IGBT gate and emitter** to ensure that the IGBT remains in the off state in case the gate driver gets disconnected due to faults.

## Applications Information
**UCC23513DWYR** is a single-channel, isolated gate driver with an **opto-compatible input** designed for power semiconductor devices such as **MOSFETs, IGBTs, and SiC MOSFETs**. It is used in applications such as:
- Motor control
- Industrial inverters
- Switched-mode power supplies (SMPS)

Unlike standard opto-isolated gate drivers, **UCC23513DWYR** does not have an LED input stage. Instead, it uses an **emulated diode (e-diode)**. To turn the **e-diode ON**, a forward current of **7mA to 16mA** must be driven into the **Anode**. This drives the gate driver output **High**, turning on the power FET.

Typically, **MCUs are not capable of providing the required forward current**, so a **buffer** must be used between the MCU and the input stage. Typical buffer power supplies are either **5V or 3.3V**. A **resistor** is required between the buffer and the input stage to limit the current. Choosing the correct resistor value is critical.

### Output Power Supply
- **Maximum output power supply voltage**: **33V (35V abs max)**
- **Configurable externally as:**
  - **Single isolated supply** up to **33V**
  - **Isolated bipolar supply** ensuring **$V_{CC}$ - $V_{EE}$** does not exceed **33V**
  - **Bootstrapped configuration** (external diode & capacitor) when using a single power supply with respect to the power ground

Typical **quiescent power supply current** from **$V_{CC}$** is **1.2mA (max 2.2mA)**.

## Detailed Design Procedure

## Input Section
### ePWM1A (Input Signal)
- **Purpose:** This is the PWM signal from a DSP or microcontroller. It controls the switching of the IGBT or MOSFET by turning the optocoupler on and off.
- **Operation:** When ePWM1A is high, it activates the LED inside the UCC23513DWYR, turning on the phototransistor and driving the gate of the IGBT/MOSFET.

---

### **Selecting Gate Driver Input Resistor ($R_{IN}$)**

- **Current Limiting for Safe Operation:** The input resistor plays a critical role in limiting the current flowing into the input diode (e-diode) of the UCC23513 isolated gate driver. The input resistor is essential to limit the current flowing into the input diode, ensuring reliable operation while preventing excessive current that could damage the device.

- **Variation in e-diode Forward Voltage Drop:** At $I_{F}$ = 10mA, the forward voltage typically ranges from **1.8V (min) to 2.4V (max)**, with a typical value of **2.1V**. This variation is influenced by a temperature coefficient **(< 1.35 mV/°C)** and a dynamic impedance **(< 30Ω)**.

- **Recommended Operating Range:** When the e-diode is forward biased, the input resistor controls the forward current ($I_F$). The threshold current ($I_{FLH}$) for turning the device ON is 2.8 mA (typical), and the recommended operating range for $I_F$ is between 7 mA and 16 mA. All electrical specifications of the device are guaranteed within this range.

- **Optimal Resistor Selection:** To achieve stable performance, the input resistor should be chosen to set $I_F$ to 10 mA under typical operating conditions, ensuring a balance between reliable switching and device protection.

### **Formula**
The input resistor ($R_{IN}$) is calculated using Ohm’s Law:

```math
R_{IN} = \frac {V_{SUP} - V_F}{I_F}
```

Where,
From the UCC23513DWYR datasheet:
- $V_{SUP}$ = 3.3V (Input supply voltage)
- $V_F$ = 1.8V (Minimum forward voltage drop of the input diode, From DataSheet, Page No. 20)
- $I_F$ = 10mA (Desired forward current for proper operation, From DataSheet, Page No. 23)

### **Calculation**
Substituting the given values:

```math
R_{IN} = \frac{3.3V - 1.8V}{0.01A}
```

```math
R_{IN} = \frac{1.5V}{0.01A} 
```

```math
R_{IN} = 150Ω
```

### **Power Dissipation Calculation for Resistor $R_{IN}$**

## **Calculation:**
The power dissipated by resistor $R_{IN}$ is given by:

```math
P_{IN} = I_{F}^2 \times R_{IN}
```

Substituting the given values:

```math
P_{IN} = (0.01A)^2 \times 150
```

```math
P_{IN} \approx 0.015W
```

### **Design Consideration**

### **Selecting the Gate Driver Resistor ($R_G$)**
The gate resistor ($R_G$) plays a crucial role in shaping the turn-on and turn-off behavior of the power MOSFET/IGBT driven by the UCC23513 isolated gate driver. It is connected in series with the gate terminal to **limit inrush current** during charging and discharging of the gate capacitance. It helps control the switching speed, reduce ringing, and mitigate excessive dv/dt and di/dt effects that can impact reliability. Proper selection of the external gate resistor ensures optimal system performance by balancing switching losses, gate drive strength, and electromagnetic interference (EMI).

### **Purpose of Gate Resistors**
Gate resistors are used to:
- **Control Switching Speed:** Adjust the turn-on and turn-off times of MOSFETs/IGBTs.

> **⚙️ Note:** Proper tuning of the gate resistor balances **switching efficiency, noise suppression, and component reliability**.

### **Optimal Resistor Selection**
To achieve an effective trade-off between **switching speed** and **EMI reduction**, the gate resistor is selected based on the desired **gate charge current**.

Selecting the appropriate gate resistor ($R_g$) is crucial for optimizing IGBT/MOSFET switching performance. This resistor controls the gate drive current, influences turn-on and turn-off times, and helps in reducing oscillations.

### 📌 Formula

The gate resistor is determined using the following steps:

### **Step 1: Calculate Gate Drive Current (Ig)**
The required gate-drive current can be estimated as:

```math
I_g = \frac{Q_g}{t_{\text{on}}}
```

Where,  
- **Ig** = Gate drive current (A)  
- **Qg** = Total gate charge (C)  
- **t<sub>on</sub>** = Desired switching time (s)  

The desired switching time is given by:

```math
t_{\text{on}} = t_{d(\text{on})} + t_r
```

- **t<sub>d(on)</sub>** = Turn-on delay time  
- **t<sub>r</sub>** = Rise time

### **Step 2: Compute Gate Resistor (Rg)**
```math
R_g = \frac{V_{gs(on)}}{I_g}
```
Where,
- **Rg** = Gate resistor (Ω)
- **Vgs(on)** = Applied gate-source voltage (V) 
- **Ig** = Gate drive current (A)

### 📖 Example Calculation

### Given Parameters
From the IKW25N120T2 datasheet:
- **Total Gate Charge**: $Q_g$ = 120 nC *(From DataSheet, Page No. 3)*
- **Switching Time**: $t_{on}$ = 49 ns *(From DataSheet, Page No. 4)*
- **Gate-Source Voltage (On)**: $V_{gs(on)}$ = 15V *(From DataSheet, Page No. 3)*

### Calculations
### Step 1: Compute Gate Drive Current
Using the equation:

```math
I_g = \frac{Q_g}{t}
```

Substituting the values:

```math
I_g = \frac{120 \times 10^{-9} C}{49 \times 10^{-9} s}
```

```math
I_g = 2.45A
```

### Step 2: Calculate the Gate Resistor
Using Ohm's Law:

```math
R_g = \frac{V_{gs(on)}}{I_g}
```

Substituting the values:
```math
R_g = \frac{15V}{2.45A}
```

```math
R_g = 6.12Ω
```

## Final Results
- **Gate Drive Current**: 2.45A 
- **Gate Resistor**: 6.12Ω  

### **Design Considerations**
- A **6.12Ω** resistor provides a balance between **switching speed and power dissipation**.
- If excessive **switching noise or oscillations** occur, consider increasing the resistance to **22Ω–30Ω**.
- For **faster switching**, a **lower value (e.g., 10Ω)** may be used, but this increases **EMI and transient stress**.
- The resistor selection depends on factors such as **gate charge, driver capability, and system noise immunity**.

### **Conclusion**
- Using a **6.12Ω** gate resistor ensures optimal **switching performance, EMI control, and reliability** of the **UCC23513** gate driver. Adjustments may be made based on **specific circuit requirements** and **EMI constraints**.
- For DIP components can be used **20Ω-30Ω** and **1/4W (0.25W)** is the best choice and it will work properly.

### Selecting $V_{CC}$ Capacitor
The **$V_{CC}$ bypass capacitor** is crucial for maintaining a stable supply voltage to the gate driver, ensuring reliable operation during high-speed switching events. It acts as a **local energy storage device**, supplying current during transients and filtering out noise. Place the cpoacitor as close to the input power pins of the octacoupler as possible to minimize impedence. 

To achieve optimal performance, **Texas Instruments (TI)** recommends using **low-ESR and low-ESL, surface-mount, multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs)** with adequate **voltage ratings, temperature coefficients, and capacitance tolerances** to ensure stability under varying operating conditions.

#### Recommended Capacitor Values:
For **$C_{VCC}$**, the following capacitors are selected:
- **0.22-μF MLCC (50V)** Placed close to the $V_{CC}$ and ground pins to filter high-frequency noise and improve transient response.
- **10-μF MLCC (50V)** to provide bulk energy storage and reduce voltage fluctuations.

#### Capacitors Used:
- **Noise decoupling capacitors:** 0.1μF capacitors (C2 and C4) filter the power input.
- **Bulk capacitors:** 4.7μF capacitors (C3 and C5) supply the IGBT gate current and minimize parasitic inductance, ensuring faster switching.

If the **bias power supply output** is located at a considerable distance from the **$V_{CC}$ pin**, an additional **tantalum or electrolytic capacitor (>10 μF)** should be placed in parallel with **CVCC** to compensate for voltage drops and maintain stability.

**Note:**
The **DC bias effect** in MLCCs can significantly reduce their effective capacitance. For example, a **25-V, 1-μF X7R capacitor** may exhibit an actual capacitance of only **500 nF** when subjected to a **15-V DC bias**. It is important to account for this effect when selecting capacitors to ensure sufficient capacitance under real operating conditions.

### **Conclusion**
- Additionally, selecting appropriate **$V_{CC}$ bypass capacitors** helps maintain stable operation and minimize voltage fluctuations. Proper component selection enhances the overall robustness of the circuit.
- For DIP components can be used **Noise decoupling capacitors 0.1μF** and **Bulk capacitors 100μF** is the best choice and it will work properly.

### **Selecting Gate-to-Source/Emitter Resistor (10kΩ)**

A **10kΩ resistor** is often connected **across the gate to source (for MOSFETs) or gate to emitter (for IGBTs)** acts as a **pull-down resistor** ensuring the gate is grounded when the controlling signal is inactive, preventing accidental or unintended MOSFET/IGBT activation. This resistor plays a crucial role in ensuring stable and reliable operation of the switching device.

### **Purpose of the 10kΩ Resistor**
- **Pull-down Function:** The 10k resistor provides a path for the gate to ground, ensuring the MOSFET is off (source and drain are not connected) when the gate driver is not actively driving the gate high. 
- **Preventing False Turn-on:** Without this resistor, the gate might float, potentially picking up noise or static charge, which could cause the MOSFET to turn on unexpectedly. 
- **Damping Oscillations:** The resistor can also help dampen oscillations and ringing that can occur during switching, improving the stability of the circuit. 

### **How it works?**
When the controlling signal is high, the MOSFET/IGBT gate is driven high, and the MOSFET/IGBT turns on. 
When the controlling signal is low or inactive, the 10k resistor pulls the gate voltage to ground, ensuring the MOSFET is off. 

### **Typical Values and Selection**

| **Resistance Value** | **Effect** |
|----------------------|------------|
| **>10kΩ** | Slower turn-off, lower power consumption |
| **10kΩ (Typical)** | Balanced performance and reliability, can range from **4.7kΩ to 100kΩ** |
| **<10kΩ** | Faster turn-off but increased gate drive power requirement |

### **Why 10kΩ?**
- **Trade-off between Pull-down Strength and Current Consumption:** A lower value resistor would provide a stronger pull-down, but it would also draw more current from the gate driver when the gate is high, potentially impacting the driver's performance. 
- **High Value for Low Current Draw:** A 10k resistor provides a good balance, allowing for a strong pull-down while keeping the current draw low when the gate is high. 

### **When to Use it**
- **General MOSFET/IGBT Circuits:** This resistor is commonly used in circuits where the MOSFET/IGBT is controlled by a microcontroller or other gate driver, especially when the gate driver might not be actively driving the gate at all times. 
- **H-bridges:** It is often used in H-bridge circuits to ensure that the MOSFETs are off when the bridge is not actively switching. 

### **Conclusion**
- A **10kΩ gate-to-source/emitter resistor** is essential for ensuring **stable operation, preventing false triggering, and improving switching response**. Proper selection of this component enhances system performance and ensures reliable operation of MOSFETs and IGBTs in power electronics applications.
- For DIP components can be used same **10Ω** and **1/4W (0.25W)** is the best choice and it will work properly.

### **Selecting Gate-Source Zener Diode Protection for MOSFETs/IGBTs**
A **gate-to-source Zener diode** or **back-to-back Zener diodes** protects MOSFETs/IGBTs from **electrostatic discharge (ESD)** and **high-voltage transients** by clamping the gate-source voltage to a safe level, preventing damage to the gate oxide when a high voltage surge occurs. 

### **Why Use a Gate-Source Zener Diode?**

### **ESD Protection**
MOSFETs are susceptible to damage from static electricity (ESD) because the thin gate oxide layer can be easily punctured by high voltages.

### **Zener Diode Function**
A Zener diode, placed between the gate and source, acts as a voltage clamp. 

### **How a Zener Diode Works for Protection**
- When a voltage surge (from ESD or other sources) appears at the gate, the Zener diode conducts, limiting the voltage across the gate-source. 
- The Zener diode's breakdown voltage is chosen to be slightly higher than the MOSFET's maximum gate-source voltage (Vgs(max)). 
- This prevents the gate-source voltage from exceeding the safe operating range, protecting the MOSFET from damage. 

### **Back-to-Back Zener Diodes**
- Used for **bidirectional protection or two Zener diodes, back-to-back** against **positive and negative voltage surges**.
- Protects the MOSFET from **both overvoltage spikes and negative transients** that could damage the **gate driver**.

### **Alternative Protection Methods**
- Some MOSFETs come with **built-in ESD protection diodes** (e.g., **TVS diodes** inside).
- **External Zener diodes** provide **greater flexibility** in defining the **clamping voltage**.
- A **series resistor** can be used along with the Zener diode to **limit inrush current** during a voltage surge.

### 🔧 **Recommended Zener Voltage Selection:**
| MOSFET V_GS(max) | Recommended Zener Voltage |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| 20V             | 15V                      |
| 25V             | 18V                      |
| 30V             | 24V                      |

For **circuit implementation**, refer to the schematic diagrams in the project documentation.

## **Conclusion**
- Using a **gate-to-source Zener diode** is a **cost-effective and reliable method** to protect MOSFETs in **power electronics, SMPS, and motor control circuits**. It helps **prevent failures due to ESD and high-voltage transients**, ensuring **long-term durability and operational stability**.
- For DIP components can be used **15V, according to your supply voltage that means the breakdown voltage** and **(500mW)** is the best choice and it will work properly.
