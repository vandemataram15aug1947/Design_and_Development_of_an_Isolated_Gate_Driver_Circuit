<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> HCPL-3120 Typical Application Circuit with Negative IGBT Gate Drive</p>  

To eliminate negative IGBT gate drive, minimize Rg and lead inductance from HCPL-3120 to IGBT gate/emitter. Mount HCPL-3120 directly above the IGBT on a small PCB. Avoid routing IGBT collector/emitter traces close to the HCPL-3120 input to prevent signal coupling. If unavoidable, reverse-bias the LED in the off state to prevent unwanted HCPL-3120 activation from transient signals.

# Selecting the Gate Resistor ($R_g$) to Minimize IGBT Switching Losses

## Step 1: Calculate $R_g$ Minimum from the $I_{OL}$ Peak Specification  

The IGBT and $R_g$ in **Figure 26 [DataSheet, Page No. 22]** can be analyzed as a simple RC circuit with a voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120.  

```math
R_g \geq \frac{V_{CC} - V_{EE} - V_{OL}}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{2.5A}
```

```math
= 7.2 \Omega \quad @ \quad 8 \Omega
```

The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value at the peak current of 2.5A **Figure 6 [DataSheet, Page No. 17]**. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. **When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts**.
## Step 2: Check the HCPL-3120 Power Dissipation and Increase $R_g$ If Necessary  

The HCPL-3120 total power dissipation $P_T$ is equal to the sum of the emitter power $P_E$ and the output power $P_O$:  

```math
P_T = P_E + P_O
```

```math
P_E = I_F \times V_F \times \text{Duty Cycle}
```

```math
P_O = (P_{O(BIAS)} + P_{O(SWITCHING)})
```

```math
= I_{CC} \times (V_{CC} - V_{EE}) + E_{SW}(R_g, Q_g) \times f
```

For the circuit in **Figure 26 [See DataSheet, Page No. 22]**, the worst case is:  
- $I_{F}$ = 16 mA  
- $R_g = 8 \Omega$  
- Max Duty Cycle = 80%  
- $Q_g = 500$ nC  
- $f = 20$ kHz  
- $T_A = 85^\circ C$

```math
P_E = 16 \text{ mA} \times 1.8V \times 0.8
```

```math
= 23 \text{ mW}
```

```math
P_O = 4.25 \text{ mA} \times 20V + 5.2 \text{ µJ} \times 20 \text{ kHz}
```

```math
= 85 \text{ mW} + 104 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 189 \text{ mW} \approx 178 \text{ mW} (P_{O(MAX)}) \text{ at } 85^\circ C
```

```math
= 250 \text{ mW} \approx 15^\circ C + 4.8 \text{ mW}/^\circ C
```

The value of 4.25 mA for $I_{CC}$ in the previous equation was obtained by derating the $I_{CC}$ max of 5 mA (which occurs at -40°C) to $I_{CC}$ max at 85°C **Figure 7 [See DataSheet, Page No. 17]**.  

Since $P_O$ for this case is greater than $P_{O(MAX)}$, $R_g$ must be increased to reduce the HCPL-3120 power dissipation.  

```math
P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)} = P_{O(MAX)} - P_{O(BIAS)}
```

```math
= 178 \text{ mW} - 85 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 93 \text{ mW}
```

```math
E_{SW(MAX)} = \frac{P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)}}{f}
```

```math
= \frac{93 \text{ mW}}{20 \text{ kHz}}
```

```math
= 4.65 \text{ µJ}
```

For $Q_g = 500$ nC, from **Figure 27 [See DataSheet, Page No. 24]**, a value of $E_{SW}$ = 4.65 µJ gives an $R_g$ = 10.3 \Omega.


The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value of $V_{OL}$ at the peak current of 2.5A. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts.

IGBTs need to be driven with a higher gate voltage swing than Si MOSFETs (+20V to -2V / -5V). The negative gate voltage must not go below -5V. Negative driving voltage is not mandatory and is suggested only when drain current is high (>50A). **The external gate resistance must be appropriately selected to minimize or eliminate ringing in the gate drive circuit. Parasitics must be minimized. Therefore, the gate driver must be located as close as possible to the gate. It is recommended to connect a 10kΩ resistor between the gate and source to prevent excessive floating of the gate during the propagation delay**.
