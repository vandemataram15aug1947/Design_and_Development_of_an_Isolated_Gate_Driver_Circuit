</p>  

<p align="center"><b>Figure 1:</b> HCPL-3120 Typical Application Circuit with Negative IGBT Gate Drive</p>  

To eliminate negative IGBT gate drive, minimize Rg and lead inductance from HCPL-3120 to IGBT gate/emitter. Mount HCPL-3120 directly above the IGBT on a small PCB. Avoid routing IGBT collector/emitter traces close to the HCPL-3120 input to prevent signal coupling. If unavoidable, reverse-bias the LED in the off state to prevent unwanted HCPL-3120 activation from transient signals.

# Selecting the Gate Resistor ($R_g$) to Minimize IGBT Switching Losses

## Step 1: Calculate $R_g$ Minimum from the $I_{OL}$ Peak Specification  

The IGBT and $R_g$ in **Figure 26 [DataSheet, Page No. 22]** can be analyzed as a simple RC circuit with a voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120.  

```math
R_g \geq \frac{V_{CC} - V_{EE} - V_{OL}}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{IOL_{\text{PEAK}}}
```

```math
= \frac{15V + 5V - 2V}{2.5A}
```

```math
= 7.2 \Omega \quad @ \quad 8 \Omega
```

The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value at the peak current of 2.5A **Figure 6 [DataSheet, Page No. 17]**. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. **When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts**.
## Step 2: Check the HCPL-3120 Power Dissipation and Increase $R_g$ If Necessary  

The HCPL-3120 total power dissipation $P_T$ is equal to the sum of the emitter power $P_E$ and the output power $P_O$:  

```math
P_T = P_E + P_O
```

```math
P_E = I_F \times V_F \times \text{Duty Cycle}
```

```math
P_O = (P_{O(BIAS)} + P_{O(SWITCHING)})
```

```math
= I_{CC} \times (V_{CC} - V_{EE}) + E_{SW}(R_g, Q_g) \times f
```

For the circuit in **Figure 26 [See DataSheet, Page No. 22]**, the worst case is:  
- $I_{F}$ = 16 mA  
- $R_g = 8 \Omega$  
- Max Duty Cycle = 80%  
- $Q_g = 500$ nC  
- $f = 20$ kHz  
- $T_A = 85^\circ C$

```math
P_E = 16 \text{ mA} \times 1.8V \times 0.8
```

```math
= 23 \text{ mW}
```

```math
P_O = 4.25 \text{ mA} \times 20V + 5.2 \text{ µJ} \times 20 \text{ kHz}
```

```math
= 85 \text{ mW} + 104 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 189 \text{ mW} \approx 178 \text{ mW} (P_{O(MAX)}) \text{ at } 85^\circ C
```

```math
= 250 \text{ mW} \approx 15^\circ C + 4.8 \text{ mW}/^\circ C
```

The value of 4.25 mA for $I_{CC}$ in the previous equation was obtained by derating the $I_{CC}$ max of 5 mA (which occurs at -40°C) to $I_{CC}$ max at 85°C **Figure 7 [See DataSheet, Page No. 17]**.  

Since $P_O$ for this case is greater than $P_{O(MAX)}$, $R_g$ must be increased to reduce the HCPL-3120 power dissipation.  

```math
P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)} = P_{O(MAX)} - P_{O(BIAS)}
```

```math
= 178 \text{ mW} - 85 \text{ mW}
```

```math
= 93 \text{ mW}
```

```math
E_{SW(MAX)} = \frac{P_{O(SWITCHING MAX)}}{f}
```

```math
= \frac{93 \text{ mW}}{20 \text{ kHz}}
```

```math
= 4.65 \text{ µJ}
```

For $Q_g = 500$ nC, from **Figure 27 [See DataSheet, Page No. 24]**, a value of $E_{SW}$ = 4.65 µJ gives an $R_g$ = 10.3 \Omega.


The $V_{OL}$ value of 2V in the previous equation is a conservative value of $V_{OL}$ at the peak current of 2.5A. At lower $R_g$ values, the voltage supplied by the HCPL-3120 is not an ideal voltage step. This results in lower peak currents (more margin) than predicted by this analysis. When negative gate drive is not used, $V_{EE}$ in the previous equation is equal to zero volts.

IGBTs need to be driven with a higher gate voltage swing than Si MOSFETs (+20V to -2V / -5V). The negative gate voltage must not go below -5V. Negative driving voltage is not mandatory and is suggested only when drain current is high (>50A). **The external gate resistance must be appropriately selected to minimize or eliminate ringing in the gate drive circuit. Parasitics must be minimized. Therefore, the gate driver must be located as close as possible to the gate. It is recommended to connect a 10kΩ resistor between the gate and source to prevent excessive floating of the gate during the propagation delay**.

## PCB Layout Design Considerations
### **Best Practices for PCB Layout**
When designing a PCB layout for the **HCPL-3120**, the following key points should be considered:
- **Placement of Low-ESR and Low-ESL Capacitors:** Position decoupling capacitors close to the VCC and VEE pins to suppress noise and support peak current demands.
- **Minimizing Loop Inductance:** Keep high-current loops as small as possible to reduce switching noise.
- **Avoiding Traces Under the Device:** Ensure that no PCB traces or copper layers exist beneath the optocoupler to maintain high-voltage isolation.
- **Thermal Management:** Increase copper thickness and use multiple vias to improve heat dissipation and reliability.

# Feature Description

## Power Supply
Since the input stage is an emulated diode, no power supply is needed at the input. The output supply, $V_{CC}$, supports a voltage range from 14V to 33V.

For operation with bipolar supplies, the power device is turned off with a negative voltage on the gate with respect to the emitter or source. This configuration prevents the power device from unintentionally turning on due to the Miller effect. The typical values of the $V_{CC}$ and $V_{EE}$ output supplies for bipolar operation are:
- **IGBTs:** 15V and -8V with respect to GND.
- **SiC MOSFETs:** 20V and -5V with respect to GND.

For operation with unipolar supply:
- **IGBTs:** $V_{CC}$ = 15V with respect to GND, $V_{EE}$ = 0V.
- **SiC MOSFETs:** $V_{CC}$ = 20V with respect to GND, $V_{EE}$ = 0V.

In this design, the secondary side is powered by a +15V and –8V rail referenced to the IGBT emitter. As shown in Figure 3.2:
- The 15V rail ($V_{CC}$) is connected to the $V_{CC}$ pin.
- The –8V rail ($V_{EE}$) is connected to the $V_{EE}$ pin of the gate driver.

The total secondary voltage is **23V**, which is used for biasing the gate driver internal circuit and to drive the IGBT gate.

## Input Power Stage
The input stage of **UCC23513DWYR** is simply the e-diode and therefore has an **Anode (Pin 1)** and a **Cathode (Pin 3)**. **Pin 2** has no internal connection and can be left open or connected to ground. The input stage does not have a power and ground pin.

When the e-diode is forward biased by applying a positive voltage to the Anode with respect to the Cathode, a forward current **(I_F)** flows into the e-diode. The forward voltage drop across the e-diode is **2.1V (typical)**. An external resistor should be used to limit the forward current. The recommended range for the forward current is **7mA to 16mA**.

When **I_F** exceeds the threshold current **I_FLH** (2.8mA typical.), a high-frequency signal is transmitted across the isolation barrier through the high-voltage **SiO₂ capacitors**. The HF signal is detected by the receiver and **V_OUT** is driven high. The dynamic impedance of the e-diode is very small (**<1.0 Ω**) and the temperature coefficient of the e-diode forward voltage drop is **<1.35 mV/°C**. This leads to excellent stability of the forward current **I_F** across all operating conditions.

If the Anode voltage drops below **V_FHL** (0.9V), or is reverse biased, the gate driver output is driven low. The reverse breakdown voltage of the e-diode is **>15V**, allowing normal operation with a reverse bias of up to **13V**.

The **UCC23513DWYR** can be used in an **interlock architecture**, where **V_SUP** can be as high as **12V**. The system designer has the flexibility to choose a **3.3V, 5.0V, or up to 12V** PWM signal source to drive the input stage of UCC23513DWYR using an appropriate input resistor.

The interlock architecture ensures that if both PWM signals are erroneously stuck high (or low) simultaneously, both gate driver outputs will be driven low, preventing shoot-through in the IGBTs.

## Output Power Stage
The **UCC23513DWYR** has a single gate driver output for controlling the **IGBT switching time**. A **gate resistor R5** of **30Ω** is selected as recommended in the IGBT module datasheet. This results in maximum peak **source and sink currents of 0.766 A** at a **+15V, –8V rail**.

For independent control of the **IGBT switching ON and OFF**, **D1** can be mounted in parallel with **R5**. A **10kΩ resistor (R6)** is connected between the **IGBT gate and emitter** to ensure that the IGBT remains in the off state in case the gate driver gets disconnected due to faults.

## Applications Information
**UCC23513DWYR** is a single-channel, isolated gate driver with an **opto-compatible input** designed for power semiconductor devices such as **MOSFETs, IGBTs, and SiC MOSFETs**. It is used in applications such as:
- Motor control
- Industrial inverters
- Switched-mode power supplies (SMPS)

Unlike standard opto-isolated gate drivers, **UCC23513DWYR** does not have an LED input stage. Instead, it uses an **emulated diode (e-diode)**. To turn the **e-diode ON**, a forward current of **7mA to 16mA** must be driven into the **Anode**. This drives the gate driver output **High**, turning on the power FET.

Typically, **MCUs are not capable of providing the required forward current**, so a **buffer** must be used between the MCU and the input stage. Typical buffer power supplies are either **5V or 3.3V**. A **resistor** is required between the buffer and the input stage to limit the current. Choosing the correct resistor value is critical.

### Output Power Supply
- **Maximum output power supply voltage**: **33V (35V abs max)**
- **Configurable externally as:**
  - **Single isolated supply** up to **33V**
  - **Isolated bipolar supply** ensuring **V_CC - V_EE** does not exceed **33V**
  - **Bootstrapped configuration** (external diode & capacitor) when using a single power supply with respect to the power ground

Typical **quiescent power supply current** from **V_CC** is **1.2mA (max 2.2mA)**.

## Detailed Design Procedure

### Selecting Gate Driver Input Resistor
The input resistor limits the current flowing into the e-diode when it is forward biased. The threshold current ($I_{FLH}$) is **2.8 mA (typical)**, and the recommended operating range for the forward current is **7 mA to 16 mA** (e-diode ON). All electrical specifications are guaranteed in this range. The resistor should be selected such that under typical operating conditions, **$I_{F}$ is 10 mA**.

#### Factors Affecting Input Resistor Selection:
- **Variation in Supply Voltage** ($V_{SUP}$)
- **Manufacturer's tolerance** for the resistor and variations due to temperature
- **Variation in e-diode Forward Voltage Drop:** At $I_{F}$ = 10mA, the forward voltage typically ranges from **1.8V (min) to 2.4V (max)**, with a typical value of **2.1V**. This variation is influenced by a temperature coefficient **(< 1.35 mV/°C)** and a dynamic impedance **(< 30Ω)**.

## Input Section
### ePWM1A (Input Signal)
- **Purpose:** This is the PWM signal from a DSP or microcontroller. It controls the switching of the IGBT or MOSFET by turning the optocoupler on and off.
- **Operation:** When ePWM1A is high, it activates the LED inside the UCC23513DWYR, turning on the phototransistor and driving the gate of the IGBT/MOSFET.

### **Selecting Gate Driver Input Resistor**

- **Current Limiting for Safe Operation:** The input resistor plays a critical role in limiting the current flowing into the input diode (e-diode) of the UCC23513 isolated gate driver. The input resistor is essential to limit the current flowing into the input diode, ensuring reliable operation while preventing excessive current that could damage the device.

- **Recommended Operating Range:** When the e-diode is forward biased, the input resistor controls the forward current ($I_F$). The threshold current ($I_{FLH}$) for turning the device ON is 2.8 mA (typical), and the recommended operating range for $I_F$ is between 7 mA and 16 mA. All electrical specifications of the device are guaranteed within this range.

- **Optimal Resistor Selection:** To achieve stable performance, the input resistor should be chosen to set $I_F$ to 10 mA under typical operating conditions, ensuring a balance between reliable switching and device protection.

### **Formula**
The input resistor ($R_{IN}$) is calculated using Ohm’s Law:

```math
R_{IN} = \frac {V_{SUP} - V_F}{I_F}
```

Where,
- $V_{SUP}$ = 3.3V (Input supply voltage)
- $V_F$ = 2.1V (Typical forward voltage drop of the input diode)
- $I_F$ = 10mA (Desired forward current for proper operation)

### **Calculation**
Substituting the given values:

```math
R_{IN} = \frac{3.3V - 2.1V}{0.01A}
```

```math
R_{IN} = \frac{1.2V}{0.01A} 
```

```math
R_{IN} = 120Ω
```

### **Design Consideration**
- In practical implementation, a **220Ω** resistor is chosen instead of **120Ω** to allow a slightly higher current.
- This results in **faster switching**, but increases the current draw, which is a trade-off between switching speed and power dissipation.

### **Conclusion**
The **120Ω resistor** ensures a robust and efficient operation of the UCC23513 gate driver, balancing switching speed and power consumption.








### Selecting Gate Driver Output Resistor
The gate driver output resistor is an essential component in controlling the switching characteristics of power MOSFETs or IGBTs. It is connected in series with the gate terminal to **limit inrush current** during charging and discharging of the gate capacitance. The value of this resistor directly affects:
- **Rise and fall times** of the switching device
- **Switching losses** and overall efficiency
- **Electromagnetic interference (EMI) performance**

For this design, a **30Ω resistor** is selected as the gate driver output resistor. This value ensures a **balance between switching speed and power dissipation**. A lower resistance can lead to **excessive gate current and potential device damage**, while a higher resistance may cause **slower switching and increased losses**.

### Selecting $V_{CC}$ Capacitor
The **$V_{CC}$ capacitor** is crucial for maintaining a stable supply voltage to the gate driver, ensuring reliable operation during high-speed switching events. It acts as a **local energy storage device**, supplying current during transients and filtering out noise.

#### Recommended Capacitor Values:
- **0.1μF ceramic capacitor**: Placed close to the $V_{CC}$ and ground pins to filter high-frequency noise.
- **4.7μF electrolytic capacitor**: Provides bulk energy storage and supports low-frequency variations.

#### Capacitors Used:
- **Bulk capacitors:** 4.7μF capacitors (C4 and C5) supply the IGBT gate current and minimize parasitic inductance, ensuring faster switching.
- **Noise decoupling capacitors:** 0.1μF capacitors (C2 and C3) filter the power input.

Using these capacitors in combination ensures:
- **Stable voltage levels**
- **Reduced power supply noise**
- **Improved system reliability**
